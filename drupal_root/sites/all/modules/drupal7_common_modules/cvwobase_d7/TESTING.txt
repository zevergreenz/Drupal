Test procedure:
1) Create NUMRECORDS (100) audit entries with the following data:
  - A random message of length between 1 to MAXLOGLEN (50)
  - Either TAG1 or TAG2 (both random strings)
  - Either CVWOBASE_MODULE or OTHERMOD (user)
  - Either user 1 or user 2
2) Tests filtering via the UI
  - Only user 2
  - Only TAG1
  - Only CVWOBASE_MODULE
  - Only TAG1 and CVWOBASE_MODULE
  - Only user 2 and TAG1
3) Test pagination
  - Maintain the last filter (Only user 2 and TAG1)
  - Set pagination limit to one-sixth of the current number of displayed records
  - Test each page to see if (only) expected records are present
4) Test deleting
  - Clear all filters and pagination limits
  - Test deleting one record ($del_test[0], randomly chosen)
  - Test deleting a random number of records between 2 and sqrt(NUMRECORDS)
  - Test deleting all the remaining records
  - After each delete operation, scan the page to see if only the remaining records are present
